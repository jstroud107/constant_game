#Kaprekar Constant Game

Kaprekar's constant is the number 6174, which is the result of a mathematical operation that involves rearranging the digits of a four-digit number and subtracting the smaller number from the larger: 
1. Start with a four-digit number that uses at least two different digits 
2. Rearrange the digits to form the largest number possible 
3. Rearrange the digits to form the smallest number possible 
4. Subtract the smaller number from the larger number 
5. Repeat steps 2â€“4 until you reach 6174

This game does the steps so you just have to enter the number in and it will show you how many iterations it took.

I still have some bugs but it is able to show you how many iterations it takes.
